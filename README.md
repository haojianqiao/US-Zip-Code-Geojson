# US-Zip-Code-Geojson
US zip code level geojson file

When doing a course project, I found that it is not very convenient to have a US zip-code level geojson format data so I uploaded one here.

I first downloaded the map data (including dbf, prj, shp, shx file) from US census website. Then with the help of https://www.statsilk.com/maps/convert-esri-shapefile-map-geojson-format and https://mapshaper.org/, I completed the conversion. Hope this could also help others. 

It is only for academic or non-commercial use.
